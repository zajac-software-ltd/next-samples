# Architecture Improvements: Custom Hooks

This refactoring addresses the issue of defining async functions inside React components by extracting them into reusable custom hooks.

## Problem

Previously, async functions were defined directly inside React components, which led to:
- Poor separation of concerns
- Difficult testing
- Code duplication
- Violation of React best practices
- Harder to maintain and reuse logic

## Solution

Created custom hooks that encapsulate all async operations and state management:

### 1. `useUsersManagement` Hook

**Location:** `/hooks/useUsersManagement.ts`

**Purpose:** Handles all user management operations for admin pages.

**Features:**
- Fetching users with pagination
- Deleting users
- Toggling user roles
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Page navigation

**Benefits:**
- All user management logic is centralized
- Easy to test in isolation
- Reusable across multiple components
- Proper error handling with user feedback
- Optimized with `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Usage:**
```typescript
const {
  users,
  pagination,
  isLoading,
  error,
  actions: { deleteUser, toggleUserRole, goToPage, clearError }
} = useUsersManagement()
```

### 2. `useAuthActions` Hook

**Location:** `/hooks/useAuthActions.ts`

**Purpose:** Handles authentication operations (sign in, sign up).

**Features:**
- User sign in with credentials
- User registration
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Automatic navigation after success

**Benefits:**
- Consistent authentication flow
- Centralized error handling
- Easy to extend with additional auth methods
- Proper separation of UI and business logic

**Usage:**
```typescript
const {
  isLoading,
  error,
  actions: { signInUser, signUpUser, clearError }
} = useAuthActions()
```

## Components Refactored

### 1. Admin Users Page (`/app/admin/users/page.tsx`)
**Before:** 100+ lines with multiple async functions, useState hooks, and useEffect
**After:** 30 lines focused purely on UI rendering and event handling

### 2. Sign In Page (`/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`)
**Before:** Complex async handleSubmit function with error handling
**After:** Simple form submission delegating to custom hook

### 3. Sign Up Page (`/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`)
**Before:** Complex async form submission with fetch logic
**After:** Clean form handling with hook delegation

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Components focus on UI rendering
- Hooks handle business logic and side effects
- Clear boundaries between presentation and logic

### 2. **Reusability**
- Hooks can be used across multiple components
- Common patterns are extracted and standardized
- Easy to share logic between similar features

### 3. **Testability**
- Hooks can be tested independently
- Components become easier to test with mocked hooks
- Business logic testing is separated from UI testing

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Changes to API endpoints only require hook updates
- Error handling is consistent across the app
- Loading states are standardized

### 5. **Performance**
- `useCallback` prevents unnecessary function recreations
- Optimized dependency arrays in useEffect
- Better React DevTools debugging experience

### 6. **Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript support with proper typing
- Return types are well-defined
- IDE autocomplete and error checking

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Custom Hooks Pattern**: Extract complex stateful logic into reusable hooks
2. **Error Boundary Pattern**: Consistent error handling and user feedback
3. **Loading States**: Proper UX during async operations
4. **Callback Optimization**: Use useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety for all operations
6. **Single Responsibility**: Each hook has a clear, focused purpose

## Future Extensions

This architecture makes it easy to add:
- **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI before server confirmation
- **Caching**: Add react-query or SWR for data caching
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data
- **Offline Support**: Queue operations when offline
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Retry logic, exponential backoff
- **Analytics**: Track user actions consistently

This refactoring significantly improves code quality, maintainability, and follows React best practices for handling async operations in functional components.
